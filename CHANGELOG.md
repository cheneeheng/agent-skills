## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-01

18 micro-skills for precise auto-triggering. Each is a thin skill that points to the relevant

| `adr` | architecture-design/adrs | Making significant design decisions |
| `domain-modeling` | architecture-design/domain-modeling | Designing entities, IDs, status fields |

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-01

### Changed

- Refactored `agent-coding-contract`, `architecture-design`, `python-backend`, `typescript-frontend`, and `release-ops` skills: replaced long, keyword-stuffed `SKILL.md` titles with a short title and a summary paragraph, and moved all detailed content into topic-specific files under a `references/` folder — matching the pattern established by `git-workflow`.
- Updated `summarize-chat` skill: replaced the verbose title with a short title and summary paragraph (no reference files needed).

### Reference files added

| Skill | New reference files |
|-------|-------------------|
| `agent-coding-contract` | agent-role, core-rules, decision-log, execution-modes, non-goals, stop-conditions, task-workflow |
| `architecture-design` | adrs, domain-modeling, event-sourcing, llm-integration, postgresql, repository-structure, rest-api |
| `python-backend` | coding-style, database, environment, exceptions, fastapi, linting, observability, security, testing |
| `release-ops` | definition-of-done, hotfix, incidents, migrations, observability, rollback, security, versioning |
| `typescript-frontend` | accessibility, coding-style, environment, error-handling, linting, sveltekit, testing |
