# Changelog

All notable changes to the `ceh` plugin are documented here.
Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

---

## [1.0.5] — 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- `lessons-learned` skill: clarified append instruction to always add new entries at the very end of `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`, never before the last existing entry.

---

## [1.0.4] — 2026-04-05

### Changed

- Standardised all Claude-generated log file paths to `docs/claude_logs/`: `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`, `DECISION_LOG.md` (referenced across `lessons-learned`, `agent-coding-contract`, `git-workflow`, and `release-ops` skills).
- Moved `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` references out of `docs/claude_logs/` to `docs/adr/DECISIONS.md` — this file is shared developer documentation, not a Claude session artifact (`git-workflow/references/code-review.md`, `architecture-design/references/rest-api.md`).

## [1.0.3] — 2026-04-03

### Added

7 micro-skills extracted from `git-workflow` for fine-grained auto-triggering on individual
git operations.

| Micro-skill | Sources | Auto-triggers when |
|---|---|---|
| `branch` | git-workflow/branching + workflows | Creating or naming a branch |
| `commit` | git-workflow/commits + workflows | Writing a commit message or staging changes |
| `open-pr` | git-workflow/pull-requests + workflows | Opening a pull request or writing a PR description |
| `merge` | git-workflow/merging | Merging a branch or choosing a merge strategy |
| `hotfix` | git-workflow/workflows + releases | Executing a critical production fix |
| `release` | git-workflow/releases + workflows | Tagging a release or bumping a version |
| `gitignore` | git-workflow/gitignore | Creating or editing a `.gitignore` file |

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-01

### Added

18 micro-skills for precise auto-triggering. Each is a thin skill that points to the relevant
reference file(s) already defined in the bundle skills — no content duplication.

| Micro-skill | Sources | Auto-triggers when |
|---|---|---|
| `adr` | architecture-design/adrs | Making significant design decisions |
| `domain-modeling` | architecture-design/domain-modeling | Designing entities, IDs, status fields |
| `event-sourcing` | architecture-design/event-sourcing | Working with event log or state snapshots |
| `rest-api` | architecture-design/rest-api | Building endpoints, choosing HTTP codes |
| `postgresql` | architecture-design/postgresql + python-backend/database | Writing SQL, asyncpg queries, schema changes |
| `llm-integration` | architecture-design/llm-integration | Integrating LLM calls or handling output |
| `fastapi` | python-backend/fastapi + python-backend/exceptions | Writing route handlers, DI, exception hierarchy |
| `python-testing` | python-backend/testing | Writing Python tests |
| `sveltekit` | typescript-frontend/sveltekit + typescript-frontend/error-handling | Routes, stores, components, API client |
| `frontend-testing` | typescript-frontend/testing | Writing frontend tests |
| `accessibility` | typescript-frontend/accessibility | Writing Svelte component markup |
| `observability` | python-backend/observability + release-ops/observability | Logging, metrics, health checks |
| `database-migrations` | release-ops/migrations | Writing or running Alembic migrations |
| `incidents` | release-ops/incidents + release-ops/hotfix | Production incidents, post-mortems |
| `definition-of-done` | release-ops/definition-of-done | Preparing to open a PR |
| `security` | python-backend/security + release-ops/security | Secrets, CORS, rate limiting, input validation |
| `code-review` | git-workflow/code-review | Reviewing PRs, leaving review comments |
| `dependency-management` | git-workflow/dependencies | Adding or upgrading packages |

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-01

### Changed

- Refactored `agent-coding-contract`, `architecture-design`, `python-backend`, `typescript-frontend`, and `release-ops` skills: replaced long, keyword-stuffed `SKILL.md` titles with a short title and a summary paragraph, and moved all detailed content into topic-specific files under a `references/` folder — matching the pattern established by `git-workflow`.
- Updated `summarize-chat` skill: replaced the verbose title with a short title and summary paragraph (no reference files needed).

### Reference files added

| Skill | New reference files |
|-------|-------------------|
| `agent-coding-contract` | agent-role, core-rules, decision-log, execution-modes, non-goals, stop-conditions, task-workflow |
| `architecture-design` | adrs, domain-modeling, event-sourcing, llm-integration, postgresql, repository-structure, rest-api |
| `python-backend` | coding-style, database, environment, exceptions, fastapi, linting, observability, security, testing |
| `release-ops` | definition-of-done, hotfix, incidents, migrations, observability, rollback, security, versioning |
| `typescript-frontend` | accessibility, coding-style, environment, error-handling, linting, sveltekit, testing |
